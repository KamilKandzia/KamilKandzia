# Hello!
I'm Kamil, currently working in one of the largest e-commerce company in Poland. 

During my bachelor studies, I realized that I want to do something other than work in the factory as an automation control engineer. For my bachelor thesis ("Comparison of algorithms and structures for processing biomedical data"), I used Matlab to create the application with GUI. It had some statistician function, and that gave me some fun of working with big data files. At my university, a new "Data Science" course has been created, which was in the English language, so I chose it for the master's studies. During this course, I learn a lot about statistics, processing data and images, classifiers, big data environment, and data visualization.

All projects in python on my [website](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/) were done outside of my studies. I had the chance to use an SQLite database, parse commands using the console and predict the seasonality of sales. Additionally, I created my model for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted. In this case, the requests are sent in JSON format by the Postman.

## Some of my projects:

|Project|Description|Language|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[Prediction model of sales in alcohol stores by using the Prophet](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/prophet/)|Build a prediction model by the prophet to indicate if the credit could be granted to some stores. For the stores, there is information about the revenue of the alcohol sales. The clustering has been implemented to find stores with similar attributes.|Python|
|[Forecasting of sales](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/forecasting/)|The aim was to create a model prediction of the sales for the next three weeks. Currently, the sales forecast is set 3 weeks ahead based on last weekâ€™s sales. The Weighted Absolute Percent Error (WAPE) is used for comparison purposes. The whole dataset contains 3 CSV files.|Python|
|[Predicting profitable customer segments](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/customer_segments/)|Models for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted were created. Based on the approaches, five different models have been made. For one of the models (GradientBoostingClassifier) to predict if the campaign should be launched for the group (one of them, or none of them)), the requests are sent in JSON format by the Postman.|Python|
|[Stock price: jumping out and in of dividend stocks around ex dividend dates](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/stock/)|The payment of dividends by a company is an attractive morsel for a shareholder. Such a company is better perceived because of its attractiveness and its willingness to share its profits with investors. But is it always profitable to own shares when dividends are paid? In this note, I will try to answer this question. For the analysis, I have chosen companies that regularly pay dividends on the Polish stock exchange.|Python|
|[NFZ API](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/nfz_api/)| The website allows for comprehensive data analysis. In particular, the emphasis was placed on sales for given branches of the NFZ. Additionally, a year-to-year analysis was introduced. As well as analysis of the division of age groups according to the attributes.|R|
|[Hotel reservation](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/hotel/)| This project focused on presenting the potential of creating a hotel reservation system design by R packages. On the website, it is a hotel gallery and system reservation. Additionally, there is an option to cancel the reservation without contact with the hotel reception (using ID and the PIN). When the booking is done, the shinyapps generate a QR code to scan it by the bank app and make a payment.|R|
