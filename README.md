# Hello!
I'm Kamil, currently working in one of the largest Polish banks. 

During my bachelor studies, I realized that I want to do something other than work in the factory as an automation control engineer. For my bachelor thesis ("Comparison of algorithms and structures for processing biomedical data"), I used Matlab to create the application with GUI. It had some statistician function, and that gave me some fun of working with big data files. At my university, a new "Data Science" course has been created, which was in the English language, so I chose it for the master's studies. During this course, I learn a lot about statistics, processing data and images, classifiers, big data environment, and data visualization.

On my [website](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/), I posted some of the projects that I created during my studies and done by myself. Some of these were not created during my education, but they concern the data science field of study.

## Some of my projects:

|Project|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[NFZ API](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/nfz_api/)| The website allows for comprehensive data analysis. In particular, the emphasis was placed on sales for given branches of the NFZ. Additionally, a year-to-year analysis was introduced. As well as analysis of the division of age groups according to the attributes.|
|[Hotel reservation](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/hotel/)| This project focused on presenting the potential of creating a hotel reservation system design by R packages. On the website, it is a hotel gallery and system reservation. Additionally, there is an option to cancel the reservation without contact with the hotel reception (using ID and the PIN). When the booking is done, the shinyapps generate a QR code to scan it by the bank app and make a payment.|
|[Prediction using the Prophet](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/prophet/)|Build a prediction model by the Prophet to indicate if the credit could be granted to some stores. For the stores, there is information about the revenue of the alcohol sales. The clustering has been implemented to find stores with similar attributes.|
|[To do list via CLI](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/todolist/)|To-do list created in Python. Data is stored in the database by using SQLite. The argparse package is used to parse the arguments from the CLI.|
